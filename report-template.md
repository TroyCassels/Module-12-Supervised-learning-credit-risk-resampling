## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* The purpose of this analysis is to predict risky loans.
* The inputs to this include loan size, interes rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio and total debt.
* In the dataset provided, there were 2,500 risky loans and approx. 75,000 healthy loans.
* The stages of the analysis involved loading the data, analysing the dataset, splitting the data into a testing and training dataset, running models and oversampling.
* Models used were Logistic Regression and Random Oversampling..

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
